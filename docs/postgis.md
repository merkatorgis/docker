# postgis base image

A [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database with [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) extensions.

## Getting started

- Copy the [`templates/postgis`](/templates/postgis) directory into your project's `docker` directory.
- Rename the `docker/postgis/schema_name` directory to something that suits your case.
- The `conf.sh` script in that directory will be run at container start.
- It calls the `schema.sh` utility, which will run `1.sh` to create version one of your database schema.
- `1.sh` uses the `pg.sh` utility to run the `create schema` statement.
- You can extend `conf.sh` and/or `1.sh` with what you need to be done.

## Data

The data files are put on a [Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/), with the same name as the container running the database. The container can be stopped, or even removed, without losing the data. If you do want to get rid of it, you can remove the volume with `docker volume rm <name>` (to list volume names: `docker volume ls`).

## Utilities

### conf

Since each `conf/subdir/conf.sh` is run at container start, you could create reusable component images, and stack them. E.g. you build a `comp/postgis` image (with a `conf/comp/conf.sh`), and use it in a different project by setting `FROM comp/postgis` in that project's `Dockerfile`.

### pg.sh

`pg.sh` connects to the database to run sql. Use either of the two options:
- `-c` to run a sql command, eg `pg.sh -c "select 1"`
- `-f` to run a sql file, eg `pg.sh -f commands.sql`

## schema.sh

`schema.sh` enables database schema version management: you start with version 1, later on provide scripts that migrate a version-1 database to version 2, and so on. It will run `1.sh`, then `2.sh`, and so on. If a database already is in version 1, it will skip `1.sh`, and only do `2.sh`, etc. An optional `0.sh` is always run.

To keep track of the schema version in the database, the utility creates a `__version()` function in each schema, that returns the current version number.
